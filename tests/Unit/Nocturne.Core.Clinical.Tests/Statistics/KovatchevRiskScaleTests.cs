/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The transform (Kovatchev et al., Diabetes Care 1997;20:1655) has a mg/dL form,
/// <c>f = 1.509 * ((ln BG)^1.084 - 5.381)</c>, and a mmol/L form,
/// <c>f = 1.794 * ((ln BG)^1.026 - 1.861)</c>. Risk is <c>10 * f^2</c>. The expected values below come from the mg/dL form; the mmol/L form
/// agrees with every one of them to within 0.7%, so the 1% tolerance accepts either and nothing
/// else. The scale is constructed so that risk runs from 0 at about 112.5 mg/dL to 100 at the
/// ends of the 20-600 mg/dL range, which is what the published bands (LBGI above 5 is high risk,
/// HBGI above 9 is high risk) are calibrated against.
